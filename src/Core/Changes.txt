11/4/2016:
* FIX: parser reduce/reduce conflicts fixed
* UP: type function definition now supports co-domain kind annotation, similarly to type annotation of return type in function bindings
* REFACT: monad builders polished and added methods for annotating inferred kind or type into nodes
* REFACT: node class now has only 1 type parameter; member 'typed' has now type object and can be freely used for annotating whatever stuff for the price of one dynamic cast
* UP: both kind inference and type inference now annotate the inferred kind (or type) within the node


6/4/2016:
* REFACT: big refactor of AST, annotations, cases, patterns and so on


4-5/4/2016:
* FIX: some fixes in typing annotations at binding site
* REFACT: AST annotation subsystem is under redesign
* REFACT: factories for lambdas have been polished
* REFACT: various renamings and refactors in AST
* REFACT: qbinding record type has been extended to support return type annotations and rec bindings alike; rec_qbinding does not exist anymore
* UP: let bindings support


2/4/2016:
* UP: all annotations, except let rec bindings, are now flex types
* FIX: annotated lambda parameters are syntactically patt_app_atoms, which means flex types are accepted by the parser: F-type check is done at typing-time
* UP: UnitTest flags now support showing input and parsed input, and forcing show of successful esits


1/4/2016:
* FIX: parser does not have reduce/reduce conflicts anymore when dealing with foralls
* UP: typing of annotations revamped and polished
* BUG: parsing of annotated lambda functions with forall parameters is bugged: need fix


30/3/2016:
* UP: disabled warnings and hints a little revamped: command line arguments have been introduced for both disabling and enabling either of the two by number;
      moreover, -Wall and -Hall options have been implemented
* UP: static_error exception and derived now have a static string property telling the name of the error (header now stubs this)
* BUG: discovered a small bug in normalization


29/3/2016:
* REFACT: UnitTest solution configuration is no more: now unit testing is triggered via command line argument "--unit-test"
* REFACT: logger class does not support profile channel anymore, and now has a custom_debug method logging in blue and with its own threshold; header must always be specified though
* REFACT: Log thresholds and related stuff has been polished and are more consistent: test methods are assigned to the debug threshold, uni and resolve channels too; test_weak_ok and
          test_fail although are treated as unleveled and are subject to no threshold
* BUG: flex type annotation management must be fixed


26/3/2016:
* UP: solution has now new configurations: Interactive Debug and Release; Interpreter Debug and Release; plus UnitTest
* UP: UnitTest revamped: sections as well as entries support flags for controlling environments and other details 


25/3/2016:
* NEW: attempt to writen a simpler non-monadic type equivalence algorithm, but I'm not persuaded it would be better so it's now in the TODO list
* REFACT: pattern and constructor factories for sugars have been polished


24/3/2016:
* REFACT: another file refactor: certains stuff in Ops have been put into new Subst and Equivalence modules
* FIX: type equality now is more robust and all relevant unit tests are successful
* BUG: unit tests using previous bindings throw an unbound error (dunno why!)


23/3/2016:
* REFACT: big refactor of former Absyn module: now it is split into several files within a source folder
* REFACT: another big source layout refactor involving UnitTest
* FIX: Intrinsic.envs0.δ environment was not forwarded to the initial state of the monad and led to unbound tyep constructors in type evaluation
* UP: a few very minor TODOs implemented and others cleaned up
* FIX: type equivalence fixed: T_App case was inverting comparison between arguments (damn!!)
* BUG: still a subtle bug in type equivalence: quantified vars must be removed from the equivalence monad state and then reput inside


20-21/3/2016:
* REFACT: various refactorings on stuff related with kind inference and type evaluation
* FIX: various fixes on type management and γ and δ environments
* BUG: Record type constructor seems to be unbound when type-evaluating tuples


18-19/3/2016:
* REFACT: lots of work in kind inference and type evaluation
* UP: type variables are not bound into a new environment γα during kind inference
* UP: all monadic bind functions now return a pair with the bound value and an undo function for unbinding the symbol
* BUG: populating intrinsics throws an unbound error when encountering type constructor list


17/3/2016:
* FIX: type equivalence fixed
* UP: kind inference and type evaluation revamped and polished: scoping of quantified variables is supported
* UP: ty_expr now evaluates to ty and not fxty anymore
* UP: fxty_expr introduced for evaluation of flex types
* UNDONE: management of scoped vars need to be completed


16/3/2016:
* REFACT: types, kinds and all relevant data structures are not comparable nor equatable anymore
* REFACT: type equivalence redesigned: now equivalence function for kinds, tys and fxtys are monadic and in mutual letrec and each 'is_equivalent' member is just an unmonadization
* BUG: type equivalence is still bugged: probably there's something wrong with the monad state being dirty across multiple type equivalence tests
* UP: UnitTest typechecker state can be reset explicity now; parse_ty_expr also resets the state everytime


15/3/2016:
* FIX: HML is working as intended: the bug seen yesterday is actually not a bug
* UP: now let bindings do not reduce to F-types by default anymore
* BUG: Fx_Foralls equivalence has a subtle bug: part of the prefix may be actually an F-type, so comparison must be performed more smartly
* TESTS: new tests for type equivalence
* REFACT: subst_ty rewritten: now it first applied tθ to the type and then it applied kθ to the result
* REFACT: some debug messages have been polished


14/3/2016:
* REFACT: static_error exception type now has code and syntax_error is a subtype
* UP: Report numbering system revamped: different types of errors have been assigned a numeric range, e.g. type errors are in the range 200..299
* UP: UnitTest module upgraded with better support of wrong tests: now specific error numbers can be detected
* TESTS: new tests on hml and higher rank arguments
* BUG: a subtle bug has been discovered: when typing "map poly ids"


11/3/2016:
* REFACT: unit tests split into sections at code level, so sections can be disabled by commenting the relevant entry in the "all" list
* TESTS: new unit tests for type equivalence
* FIX: type equivalence fixed: all unit tests now succeed


10/3/2016:
* REFACT: Report slightly revamped
* FIX: Fastprintf discovored being bugged: whenever the result of a printf (or similar function) is unified with a tuple type, Fastprintf implementation crashes. This
       implies that any formatted use of raise would crash, because the result type of any raise is a type variable that unifies with anything formatted raises using
       kprintf: after 3 days of debug, I finally came out with a workaround. Anyway in the end Fastprintf does not perform better than F# stdlib one, so it's not worth using
* UP: Log polished and optimized through a reflection trick: lines that would be masked out due to threshold are now not processed at all


7/3/2016:
* UP: Fastprintf third-part library added to dependencies and in use
* REFACT: Log refactored heavily and some stuff in FSharp.Common.Prelude too


5/3/2016:
* UP: let rec..and ported to HML and tested briefly. Behaviour is like lambda, i.e. polymorphic uses of rec functions need to be annotated like a lambda parameter
* FIX: pattern applications not involving a data constructor as left-most term are rejected


4/3/2016:
* UP: some patterns and let rec being upgraded to HML


3/3/2016:
* FIX: var pretty printing polished and fixed for working with various compilation symbols
* NEW: kinded interface for types having the kind property
* NEW: type equivalence logic stuffed into a monad: it can now be reused with several types in an easier way
* FIX: match rule seems to work
* BUG: let rec seems to be wrong: it's being worked


2/3/2016:
* UP: ty and fxty equality rewritten: it now deals with variables in a special way, such that for example forall 'a 'b. 'a -> 'b is equal to forall 'x 'y. 'x -> 'y and even
      when quantified variables are out of order, e.g. forall 'a 'b. 'a -> 'b is equal to forall 'y 'x. 'x -> 'y
* REFACT: UnitTest code simplified: kind of expected flex type is not returned explicitly anymore, as it can always be fetched by calling .kind
* UP: UnitTest comparison has been improved: it now supports type equality as well as verbatim-equality (using pretty printing)
* REFACT: some important renaming: M.unify is now M.unify_F, and so mgu is mgu_F; also, new monadic M.unify_fx stands for old mgu_scheme which has now become mgu_fx
* UP: match rule rewritten using flex types and flex unification
* FIX: annot rule had wrong translation: now the translated inner expression is set as the whole translated output
* NEW: method fxty.is_really_flex tests whether the flex type could be actually be a System-F type


1/3/2016:
* UP: UnitTest revamped with flag subsystem for special behaviours
Evento senza titolo* UP: UnitTest types are now subject to anonymization of all type variables, unless StrictVarNames flag is enabled


29/2/2016:
* UP: Reserved_Cons removed from expr AST: it used to exist because of the evaluator, but it is not necessary as new data constructors X can be bound to Δ as (X, V_Cons (X, []))
* REFACT: scoped vars have now become a set of vars
* UP: split_prefix monadic function has now become split_for_gen and calls the pure version, which deals with Γ and scoped vars
* REFACT: fork monadic methods have been renamed to undo
* UP: UnitTest module improved even more


28/2/2016:
* UP: some work on scoped type variables
* REFACT: redesigned how log thresholds are set according to solution configuration and interpreter mode
* FIX: kind inference and type evaluation debug information revamped
* FIX: lambda rule of HML has been generalized to support annotations in a transparent way: all ftv are added to the prefix, whether belonging to an annotation or not
* FIX: subst_ty now substitutes kinds also to the result of a substitution


27/2/2016:
* UP: var normalization upgraded: it now supports a stack of normalization contexts, making the behaviour undoable and fitting with recursive uses; it also supports use of
      normalization context in a pure way, passing it as argument to pretty_normalized
* UP: UnitTest module text output reworked and polished
* FIX: unit tests are currenlty all correct
* UP: translated type defined for enforcing a strongly typed behaviour of the translation sub-system, which was not robust - now it is


26/2/2016:
* FIX: location column numbers and biases are probably wrong: fixed now but not sure it's really done
* UP: UnitTest messages rewritten using PPrint library of document formatting combinators


25/12/2016:
* REFACT: enormous and complicated redesign and abstraction of pattern and constructor factories in Absyn
* FIX: T_Forall is now pretty printed with kind annotations on quantified vars when kind is not star
* REFACT: Intrinsic.envs0 are now computed lazyly
* FIX: datatype declarations fixed: need more testing of course, but seems to work


24/12/2016:
* REFACT: Globals.location type removed: it didn't make sense, as the superclass Parsing.location is enough
* NEW: location can now be merged with another location and subtend an area
* NEW: make_patterns generalizes the creation of multiple-occurrence constructors and active patterns given the single-shot versions of the constructor and the pattern
* UP: arrows and apps constructors and active patterns are now created by using make_patterns


23/2/2016:
* REFACT: reserved identifiers tools polished, as well as list special constructor names
* REFACT: wildcard_reserved_id does not exist anymore: fresh_reserved_id is used instead
* UP: list support completed
* UP: credits text in Args module revamped, as well as management of assembly attributes
* UP: the whole Intrinsic module has been revamped to support datatype definitions and other declarations
* UP: datatype declaration typechecking is under revamping


22/2/2016:
* REFACT: compilation symbols enabling debug in unification and inference have been polished
* FIX: subsume fixed
* NEW: lots of work and rework on UnitTest module
* REFACT: cputime-based log extension methods moved to Main
* REFACT: interactive console code is now in a separate Interactive module
* NEW: new compilation switch for enforcing normal form in unification
* REFACT: many minor refactors involving exception handling, log and stuff


21/2/2016:
* FIX: finally I found the reason why HML did not work! More tests must be done but it's likely the right direction: generalization (performed by calling split) did not take into account
       the free variables in Γ; now split call sites have been fixed
* FIX: ty.search_var did not work and caused active pattern T_ForallsK and all other patterns relying on it to throw an unexpected exception. Now fixed
* UP: var type has now custom equality and comparison
* FIX: subsume used to be bugged for a long time, but now a few changed seems to have fixed it; skolem escape check not tested yet, though
* TEST: finally some tests are successful: the following Lw function seem to typecheck correctly: const, app, id, i (which is the application "id id") and the monomorphic expression "app id 3"


20/2/2016:
* DEBUG: new pure version of HML infer algorithm written in a private module


18-19/2/2016:
* I'm starting to think that HML paper shows a wrong implementation of the type inferece. The prototype in Haskel seem to not perform generalization on (APP) when typing "let app f x = f x".
* DEBUG: some more debug for HML


16-17/2/2016:
* NEW: new compilation switch: ENABLE_HML_FIXES; currently 2 fixes exist:
       (1) detection of forall ('a :> _|_). 'a in nf;
       (2) subsume prunes all variables introduced locally within the result substitution
* BUG: without any HML fix, inferece still produce 2 unquantified variables in typing "let app f x = f x"


15/2/2016:
* HML seems to work now
* REFACT: fxty.Fx_Forall is now pretty printed as "Forall" with a capital letter when DEBUG is enabled, in order to distinguish System-F quantification from flexible type quantification
* FIX: fxty.nf fixed: it now reduces flexible forall ('a :> _|_). 'a to System-F forall 'a. 'a directly. This seems enough to make HML inference correct
* REFACT: cleaned up a lot ForallsQ and other stuff like that
* NEW: instantiation of quantifier+unquantified_ty is now done via a static method and not anymore by active patterns
* NEW: (|Mapped|) active pattern: promoted to Prelude
* REFACT: refactoring datatype involved in gen_bind for generic multiple binding management


12/2/2016:
* REFACT active patterns dealing with quantification, instantiation, unquantification etc. have been redesigned
* BUG: still not working: it still inferes the same it used to infer before the first big fix, still with no fxty


11/2/2016:
* REFACT: tksubst is not a type alias anymore but a record
* FIX: is_instance_of redesigned and refactored as a member of type ty
* REFACT: monad builders designed reworked
* REFACT: major refactor done
* FIX: D_Type declarations now create a dummy Td_Decl when calling type evaluation and kind inference
* BUG: (|Fx_ForallsQ|) does not handle possible foralls within the internal ty node


10/2/2016:
* REFACT: constraint, types, schemes and flex types instantiation (i.e. variable refreshment) has been widely redesigned
* REFACT: big refactor of monad builders
* UP: more modules ported to the new design
* UP: unification of T_Forall does not unify kinds of the sub-term anymore, as it was done automatically by recursion


9/2/2016: [v0.9.1]
* version bump due to major refactor
* REFACT: flexible types reimplemented as a new datatype and former type "ty" stands now for System-F types
* REFACT: substitution system cleaned up
* REFACT: unquantified types are now detectable via an active pattern
* REFACT: generalization and instantiation redesigned adn cleaned up, both monadic and not
* UP: scoped variables now support kind variables as well


8/2/2016:
* REFACT: better printing of debug information on mgu, subsume and mgu_scheme
* FIX: T_ForallsQ now refreshes quantified variables: it seems that in HML paper that is the expected behaviour
* DEBUG: lots of debugging on HML


6/2/2016:
* NEW: Unit test module written with a simple system for testing type inference
* NEW: most tests have been taked from HML prototype tests
* BUG: discovered a bug in typing "let f = id id", where id : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a


5/2/2016:
* REFACT: let bindings support for annotation has been rewritten
* FIX: rec bindings support for HML has been introduced - need testing
* NEW: let bindings convert flex types to F-types by default, unless a flexible type annotation is provided by the user


4/2/2016:
* FIX: tonight I had a revelation and I fixed HML :) Method ty.nf did not adhere precisely to the specification, as it didn't detect types of form "forall ('a :> _|_). 'a" as System-F types,
       but it rather treated them as flexible, reducing always to _|_. This was the source of all problems, as it made type inference lose type variable information. Now nf works as intended
       and the whole HML system infers correctly
* NEW: a new family of active patterns Flex_* have been defined for dealing with flexible types in a semi-typed way
* REFACT: ty.is_nf method exists no more
* REFACT: ty.is_ftype method has been rewritten without using structural comparison
* FIX: columns in error reporting has been increased by 1 by setting col_bias to 1



3/2/2016:
* REFACT: var pretty printing changed again: now variables are printed as unquantified only when quantification has been enabled by a forall. In other words, when a T_Forall is encountered
          quantification is enabled for the type sub-branch; otherwords vars are printed as quantified even if they are unquantified (this is for readability purposes, where vars in substitutions
          or in sub-terms are better printed without the underscore prefix)
* FIX: in rule (LAMBDA) the prefix is now reset to original after inferring the sub-term (used to keep the newly inserted variable, which was wrong)
* FIX: monadic extend was bugged: now there's only a pretty natural extend dealing with the Q within the monad, and no more extend overloads dealing with Q as a parameter
* FIX: in rule (LAMBDA) uses of former monadic extend overloads have been rewritten using the pure version of extend
* REFACT: var.reset_normalization does not take a set of quantified variables anymore: it just resets normalization; it is now used only by Report, not by scheme and kscheme pretty printers anymore
* FIX: var.reset_normalization didn't work as intended when compilation flag DISABLE_VAR_NORM was enabled; now it should
* REFACT: some new var.add_quantified static overloads dealing with a single var, a sequence of vars and a prefix
* REFACT: substitution composition (again!!) was reversed: probably it didn't matter anyway, but hey...


2/2/2016:
* REFACT: new open and closed version of rowed types (records and variants)
* REFACT: all pt_* functions have been renamed to W_* and all pk_* to Wk_*
* REFACT: Globals module has been lifted up in the source compilation order
* NEW: ty.constructed_form method implemented according to the HML prototype (though it does not appear in the paper) and called bvy subsume and mgu_scheme


1/2/2016:
* REFACT: much debug over HML
* FIX: lots of fixes in normalform, subsume and mgu
* NOTE: the reason why (APP) rule seems to infer always a wrong forall 'a. 'a is that the HML paper might be wrong - not sure though


29/1/2016:
* UP: lambda parameter annotated type now unifies with star
* REFACT: HML parts of type inference have been monadized
* UP: unification between type applications now unifies kinds of both left-hands to an arrow
* UP: several minor TODOs in the task list have been done or pruned
* REFACT: new small utiliy: ty.fresh_star_var_and_ty: it computes both the var and the ty
* FIX: substitution composition fixed again: it was applied in reverse order sometimes


28/1/2016:
* UP: kind unification integrated within new mgu algorithm for HML


22-27/1/2016:
* HML being debugged extensively
* FIX: many fixes, major and minor
* REFACT: variable printing, scheme printing and lots of other stuff redone
* REFACT: Report.prompt now supports arbitrary values after the type, i.e. a separator (e.g. "=" for values) and a value; moreover, it introduces an EOL if the printing
          would truncate due to console buffer width
* UP: quantified variables (or a whole prefix) can now be added to the set of quantified variables for pretty printing normalized vars; the use-binding-and-IDisposable
      trick has been used for removing vars from the set when coming up from recursion without the need to pass a parameter to ty.pretty


21/1/2016:
* FIX: when the left-hand pattern of a let-binding is a plain identifier, no trivial unification takes place between the inferred type and the type inferred for the pattern


20/1/2016:
* UP: HML implementation largely done
* TEST: testing of HML system started: a few early bugs have been fixed, but there's gonna be a lot of work to do yet
* REFACT: lots of type manipulation stuff, useful for putting asserts checking System-F types, normal form etc.
* FIX: old type inference code introducing fresh vars into Γ have been updated to introduce a boundary for that var into the prefix as well.
       One example of this is pt_patt dealing with P_Var term


19/1/2016:
* REFACT: prefix is now a heavyweight type which is basically a native tail-append list; all operations have become members
* REFACT: ForallK and ForallsK rewritten simply using the ty.kind method on the type bound
* UP: kind inference and type evaluation for Forall term fixed
* REFACT: convention for computation expression builder instances changed: now each type having one has a static let
          binding B within the type namespace using a module qualification trick via F# attributes


18/1/2016:
* REFACT: a lot of minor and major refactors to the whole code
* UP: scheme unification and unify_scheme implemented
* UP: prefix update and slicing implemented
* REFACT: Solve term unification rewritten using a new M.attemp_unify monadic method in place of try_mgu pure function (which still exists btw, as it's been used elsewhere)


17/1/2016:
* REFACT: substitution renamed: now tθ stands for tsubst and kθ for ksubst, leading to a very natural θ for both. Symbols Σ and Θ are not used anymore
* UP: unification for HML implemented roughly: needs completion and testing of course
* UP: skolemification of type variables implemented via T_Cons; kinds are a problem though. Probably T_Forall should carry kinds along with quantified variables
* FIX: split fixed: it used to reverse the prefix, now it keeps the order


16/1/2016: [v0.9.0]
* version bump due to new HML system integration
* REFACT: predicate is no more as it did not make much sense: every item schemes consist of is now inlined into the scheme record directly
* REFACT: big refactor doe to new HML system
* UP: new HML (APP) rule implemented and (ABS) finished
* UP: lots of other minor upgrades to code: it now compiles but it crashes on something mysterious


15/1/2016:
* REFACT: lots of work in understanding, implementing and integrating HML
* REFACT: all type definitions for HML has been refactorized into types: scheme, quantified schemes etc are no more
* UP: primal unannotated lamba inference written; split and extend prefix utilities written as well
* REFACT: prefixes are not simple lists and no more Env.t
* REFACT: the bottom type has been lifted to ty: consider that even if bottom = forall 'a. 'a, there is the need to define it as a native type term because in HML quantified variables have bounds, and
          therefore forall 'a. 'a = forall 'a >= bottom. 'a which would result in a recursive value
* REFACT: type visitors (Vi_T active patterns) deprecated


14/1/2016:
* UP: new data type definitions for HML: schemes, quantified schemes and types; prefixes are implemented using Env.t


11/01/2016:
* REFACT: Foralls active patterns and virtual constructor; support for universal quantifier in type expressions and type
* REFACT: support for work on first-class polymorphism started


8/01/2016:
* TODO.txt file reworked
* looking for a serious test suite: OCaml test suite could do, with a little 


7/01/2016:
* FIX: scoped type variables implemented and seems to work in general. Needs more testing though.


22/12/2015:
* REFACT: var printer greatly redesigned and rewritten: now it deals with named vars more consistently, and new names are generated if already allocated by
          named vars; it also renames named vars which are accidentally equal to generated names for anonymous vars.


18/12/2015:
* REFACT: more tyvars again: VarPrinterState module rewritten because static members were not suitable for the purpose, as they introduce unit closures


15/12/2015:
* REFACT: var class reworked: former private module for effecting normalization has now become a bunch of static private members; normalization now
          keeps possible var name
* REFACT: all prefixes in prompt have now become configurable; prompt prefixes are also trimmed and flattened more consistently now


14/12/2015:
* REFACT: many minor changes are reworks, also involving named type variables


10/12/2015:
* REFACT: support for named type variables: var type reworked and scoping rules of named type variables implemented


23/12/2015:
* REFACT: closed-world overloading introduced: no need for the 'overload' declaration; 'let over' at will; locally resolved via a special tag for constraints


18/11/2015:
* first GitHub publish
* started writing of documentation on README.md


9/11/2015: [v0.8.0]
* all code migrated to F# 4.0 and .NET 4.6


4/11/2015:
* FIX: usage of substitution composition was sometimes wrong: arguments were inverted in some cases, now should be fixed
* UP: substitution composition implementation was quite optimized but might have led to unexpected results: now it's been implemented using second
      operand domain restriction, as in "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_(logic)"


3/11/2015:
* FIX: eval cancellation and ctrl-c handling has finally been fixed
* REFACT: V_Redux values now take an Eval.context as extra argument in the closure part of the pair: this makes cancellation possible by passing the
          context at the time when the beta redux occurs
* NEW: dynamic configuration sub-system for run-time flags: basically it consists of a singleton class with getter/setter properties
* UP: support for Unicode symbols and greek letters for type variables based on actual .NET console capabilities
* NEW: Unicode and greek support can be enabled/disabled via command line arguments
* REFACT: FreeCons and P_FreeCons have been renamed to PolyCons and P_PolyCons respectively. This makes more sense and is more consistent.
* REFACT: ticked identifiers, upper as well as lower cased, have been subject to redesign due to inconsistencies. Now this is the current scenario:
                  X | x     = Var      =>  typing must discriminate between variable names and data constructor names
                  'X | 'x   = FreeVar  =>  typing must discriminate between constrained variable names and constrained data constructor names
                  `X        = PolyCons =>  polymorphic variant
                  `x        = ?        =>  does it make sense? can it be used for something?


26/10/2015:
* FIX: major changes in the ctrl-c signal handling
* REFACT: Eval module functions support a context; currently hosting a cancellation token for making evaluation legally cancellable according to the F# async paradigm
* UP: FSharpCommon.Log.console_logger class now supports a lock-and-apply helper method (used also by the main prompter itself as low-level internal API)
* FIX: in interactive mode now all overlapping console output have been fixed: non-logger printf calls are now encapsulated within lock-and-apply sections


22/10/2015:
* UP: program components are now all optional: namespace at the top of source file can be omitted, as well as main expression at the bottom
* NEW: interactive mode can now interpret a source file before prompting the user; declarations are bound to the global environment and user expressions can use them
* NEW: new typing_state_builder superclass that allows no translation
* NEW: node_typing_state_builder is now a subclass of typing_state_builder which simply adds a translated setter-only property
* REFACT: old node_typing_state_builder.translate method has now become a non-monadic setter-only property: all call sites updated accordingly
* NEW: module Intrisic now defines a shortcut record for all environments


20/10/2015:
* NEW: interactive mode supports cancelling of current evaluation
* RAFACT: CTRL-C handler reworked but still a little bugged 


19/10/2015;
* FIX: minor fixes multiple mgu algorithms printing
* REFACT: new printing closures and rec-closures in evaluator


15/10/2015:
* FIX: mgu comparison has been fixed: algorithms seem to behave uniformly
* REFACT: solution configuration manager redesigned


14/10/2015: [v0.7.0]
* REFACT: new solution and projects created: Core is the parsing and typing engine and behaves like a library; Interpreter is just the command line
          evaluator application (including interactive mode)


04/10/2015:
* REFACT: mgu has been implemented in 3 ways: computation expression, state monad and pure
* REFACT: mgu function comparison has been implemented but does not work as intended yet


16/9/2015: [v0.6.1]
* UP: FSharpCommon computation expression module has been redesigned greatly
* REFACT: MGU algorithms refactored according to new computation expression system. As of now, 3 versions exist: pure CPS, state-monading, function-based computation expression.
          Subtle issue: a non-function-based computation expression could not do the work, because the MGU algorithm needs to know the current substitution at each recursion
          step; and no "get_current_state"-like method can be written unless closures are employed.


3/9/2015:
* FIX: computation expression builder base class was bugged (again!). Refactoring is on the work...
* REFACT: constraint resolution is temporarely not working because type scheme instantiation function uses 'constr' builder, which is bugged as said above


27/8/2015:
* REFACT: type env now binds records rather than tuples


25/8/2015:
* FIX: is_principal_type_of and is_instance_of have been subject to redesign; still not working as intented though


28/7/2015: [v0.6.0]
* REFACT: F# PowerPack is not referenced anymore. Argument parser is now embedded into FSharp Common library
* REFACT: multiple attempts to rewrite the MGU code by means of computation expression have been stabilized: now both pure and computational versions of the MGU algorithm are implemented


5/2/2015:
* FIX: MGU computation expressions fixed


3/2/2015:
* REFACT: computation expression builder reworked for KMGU and MGU algorithms


29/1/2015:
* REFACT: mgu algorithsm rewritten as computation expressions: this leads to better error messages thanks to CPS


26/1/2015:
* REFACT: constraint and constraints types redesigned: now the latter is a special class with a set of the former within
* FIX: the refactoring above should fix some issues in the constraint resolution system dued to wrong associativity and identity


22/1/2015:
* FIX: loosen construct fixed and tested


21/1/2015:
* REFACT: new inst method in state monad: instantiate scheme and inherits constriaints. All lookups must use this


20/1/2015:
* REFACT: Env module in FSharpCommon has been polished: old non-objective API has been deprecated, as well as the monadic wrapper.
          Moreover, pretty printing has been redesigned.


14/1/2015:
* FIX: predicate pretty printing has been rewritten; still not very elegant though


13/1/2015:
* UP: flex construct has been renamed to loosen and syntax is with a post-fix HASH
* FIX: is_istance_of rewritten again


12/1/2015:
* NEW: post-fix question mark construct loosens all constraints gathered while typing the given sub-expression, making them non-strict
* REFACT: variable qualifiers do not exist anymore; AST for vars, freevars, cons and freecons is now simpler


8/1/2015:
* FIX: fixed some problems with the reworked jenv bindings sub-system
* BUG: GADTs are still not working


7/1/2015:
* back to work on Lw after a several week break
* REFACT: M.search_by_name renamed to search_binding_by_name_Γ, because it returns the whole binding
* REFACT: sub-system for looking up bindings in Γ has been reworked


17/11/2014:
* REFACT: jenv reworked: JId_Overload does not exist anymore; jenv_mode encodes that on the value-part of the environment
* REFACT: Jb-prefixed active patterns and M.search_by_name_Γ reworked
* NEW: free constructor identifiers for poly variants are introduced by back-tick
* NEW: @ID stands for first-class select function for records
* NEW: identifiers in expressions can be lowercase or uppercase alike; in patterns the same happens


15/11/2014:
* TAG: v0.4.0: GADTs supported but type inference works well for ordinary variant usage only as of now
* NEW: definitions of basic types for GADT implementation


13/11/2014:
* NEW: T_ConsApps constructor and active pattern for dealing with curried datacons applications


12/11/2014:
* REFACT: location management has changed: now context does not keep track of it anymore, and location is forwarded where needed as an extra argument
* FIX: value type was not equatable, now fixed
* UP: list management seems to work, and so simple GADTs


11/11/2014:
* FIX: many minor fixes for Apps patterns
* NEW: list literals and patterns are desugared to predefined data constructors
* UP: datatype declaration improved, but still not working


10/11/2014:
* NEW: new syntax for do-blocks: do { statements.. }
* NEW: new alternate syntax for pattern-matching cases: (match e with | function) { [|] p [when e] => e.. }. This syntax lets the user specify patterns or type patterns with
       the infix arrow operator withouth using brackets; moreover, it makes the match..with construct self-contained when used as a statement
* REFACT: App3 active patterns no longer exist: now Apps exist for each family of terms, like Arrows
* NEW: GADTs definition construct initiated: basic well-formedness checks implemented; type inference not yet
* REFACT: value-level patterns no longer have a P_Cons term holding parameters; P_App defined but not yet supported in run-time pattern matching


7/11/2014:
* FIX: substitution composition was bugged AGAIN: arguments was inverted; now it works as it should: first argument is the old substitution, and the second is the new one
* FIX: fixed many minor and major bugs in kind inference and type evaluation of declarations
* REFACT: prompting of type-language bindings uses now a cache for outputting inferred kind and evaluated type on the same log line even if the two are computed separately
* FIX: parsing of type patterns have been upgraded: arrows can now be patterns, but they do not belong to the grammar non-terminal used by cases of the match-with construct
* FIX: infix operators are now supported both at parse and at pretty-printing levels for every language layer


6/11/2014:
* FIX: type inference of typed paramers have been fixed to include kind annotation of type expression, if present
* UP: variable normalization subsystem implemented with side-effects on global printer state
* FIX: many other minor improvements and fixes


5/11/2014:
* UP: syntactic sugar for let and let rec within type expressions supporting a redundant 'type' qualifier 
* REFACT: declaration log system has been cleaned up
* REFACT: param and binding pretty printing subsystem changed again and again, but still not as beatiful as it could be


4/11/2014:
* UP: type bindings are now recursive, but kinding is not working properly yet


3/11/2014:
* UP: freevar syntax is ticked again; freevars can be followed by BANG as well as ordinary vars for forcing lousy resolution
* UP: manual resolution can specify any type expressions at right side of WITH: it must unify with a record and its bindigs are treated as the old constraints
* FIX: match..with construct now does not conflicts anymore with the manual resolve with-clause


2/11/2014:
* FIX: kind htuples are now separated by commas; constructor arguments are analogous to htuple application, even though htuple is not really an AST term


31/10/2014:
* FIX: resolved several reduce/reduce conflicts due to type expressions and type patterns
* UP: kind syntax redesigned and improved
* REFACT: HTuples are not rows anymore, but native terms in the type language; tuples are still row though.
          Kinds have HTuples as native terms as well, but do not have tuples: only tupled arguments non-first-class citizen for constructor applications


30/10/2014:
* REFACT: variable substitutions have been introduced and type or kind substitutions have been rewritten in function of variable substitutions
* REFACT: variable normalization subsystem totally rewritten: now its simpler and based on variable substitutions
* FIX: several minor bugs fixed in dealing with type closures, bindings etc.
* FIX: kind substitutions and the relation with type substitutions have been fixed
* FIX: HTuples must be kinded before Rows otherwise the default behaviour of rows will be inferred: HTuples can have types of any kind within


29/10/2014:
* REFACT: type and kind normalization subsystem in reworking


28/10/2014:
* FIX: free vars, identifiers and constructors are now 3 separate identifiers in the type language
* REFACT: intrinsic type and kind constructor naming have been cleaned up
* NEW: type pattern-matching support started


27/10/2014:
* NEW: kind bindings introduced at value-level; still missing at type-level though
* NEW: new environment for kind constructors 


25/10/2014:
* FIX: tuples and tupleds fixed and row creator updated
* NEW: testing fibonacci infinite lists in F# for experimenting with lazy computations: ideally, where-bindings in Lw should be automatically recursive and lazy


24/10/2014:
* REFACT: kinding subsystem refactored and cleaned up furtherly
* REFACT: all row types are now generated by an utility function which creates record, variant and tuple constructors and active  patterns given the definitions of Rowed and (|Rowed|_|)
* REFACT: many minor and major refactorings dealing with rows, tuples and tupled


23/10/2014:
* REFACT: visitor active-patterns have been deprecated
* NEW: record pattern can now be { x; y ..}: each label is bound to an identifier with the same name (i.e. the result is opening the record for the set of mentioned identifiers)
* REFACT: rec-bindings and type-expr-bindings now have a (typed and kinded, respectively) on the left side instead of a pattern; parser have been updated accordingly
* REFACT: grammar and parse rules for declarations are now clearer
* NEW: type declarations implemented
* REFACT: monads designed have been cleaned up: now a builder superclass exists which does not deal with nodes and defines no Yield; a first subclass deals with nodes in general and defines a Yield for typing,
          plus it provides the translate method; a second subclass deals with ty_expr nodes specifically, supports Yield for kinds and for annotating kinds on ty_expr nodes


22/10/2014:
* REFACT: substitutions now handle either kinds or both types and kinds, as well as unification etc.
* NEW: all type expressions now are typed by means of an annotation on the node; each type-value term contains a kind


21/10/2014:
* NEW: nodes have a side-effected field for annotating types
* NEW: state monad builder has now a new subclass defining a Yield that annotates inferred kinds on each ty_expr node


20/10/2014:
* FIX: eject and inject changed again, but not tested yet
* REFACT: kind inference adn type evaluation have been split again; a commodity for performing both has been defined


17/10/2014:
* NEW: eject and inject renamed and redesigned:
                Γ ⊢ e : π. { x1 : t1 .. xn : tn } -> t    
                Γ ⊢ let x = { x1 = x1 .. xn = xn } in e x : π'. t' ~~> e*
    (EJECT-PAR) --------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ fun x <= e : π'. t' ~~> e*

                Γ ⊢ e : { x1:t1 .. xn:tn }. t  
   (INJECT-PAR) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ fun x => e : {}. { x1:t1 .. xn:tn } -> t ~~> fun x -> let x1 = x.x1 and .. xn = x.xn in e

* BUG: the two rules above are still broken
* UP: kind inference and type evaluation are now merged into one single operation


16/10/2014:

* NEW: tuples have been encoded by using record rows { #1 : t1 .. #n : tn }: this takes place in types as well as in patterns and expressions
* NEW: kind inference and type evaluation subsystems initiated
* REFACT: subst have beeen rendered polymorphic and application to types etc. are now global functions
* TODO: a new environment for binding free type variables is neeeded: γ is just for type constructors/identifiers, which have different scopes than ticked variables


15/10/2014:
* REFACT: IfThenElse term has been modified to always support the Else expression; when missing Unit literal is sugared by the parser
* FIX: many minor and major fixes and improvements to the parser
* NEW: pattern parameters for lambda terms support now cases and are desugared to match with tuples; let-time functions do not support that for now.
       Difference between fun and function is that fun supports multiple patterns syntactically atomic app-wise, while function supports any single pattern
                 Γ ⊢ fun x1 .. xn -> match (x1, .., xn) with p11 .. p1n -> e1 | pm1 .. pmn -> em : t ~~> e'
         (ABS-P) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Γ ⊢ fun p11 .. p1n -> e1 | pm1 .. pmn -> em : t ~~> e'


14/10/2014:
* NEW: parse-type sugar for making record labels first class functions:
                Γ ⊢ fun r -> r.l : { l : α } -> α ~~> e
         (#LAB) ----------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ #l : { l : α } -> α ~~> e

* UP: syntax for inner bindings prefixes the LET token everytime, even for open, type, ecc.
* NEW: system for type expressions and patterns has been developed but not finished yet
* REFACT: grammar of type annotations in expressions and patterns have been refactored to reduce conflicts


13/10/2014:
* NEW: system for type expressions and patterns introduced: still very confused though


10/10/2014:
* FIX: manual resolution works better now: multiple suggestions over the same symbol are applied to constraints in order of appearence; unification takes place increasingly and can truly help
       resolving other constraints indirectly.
* UP: warning for manually resolved symbols referring to multiple constraints is now unused
* FIX: final automatic resolve rule is this:
                ∃ (x#n : t) ∈ π. (x$k : σ) ∈ Γ
                ¬∃ (x'#m' : σ') ∈ Γ. mgu(inst(σ'), t) < mgu(inst(σ), t)
         (AUTO) ---------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ e : π - (x#n : t). t' ~~> let x#m = x$k in e


9/10/2014:
* FIX: manual resolution finally fixed: desugaring to a let was not the right way. Now it behaves differently: for each user-specified constraint type, if it exists within the
       current constraints set, then the types are unified. This simply will help automatic resolution to find instances in case of ambiguity, because those type variabels causing such
       ambiguity may be substituted. Moreover, in case the constraint refers to an overloaded symbol, unification against the declared principal type.
                Γ ⊢ e : π. t ~~> e'
                ∀ xi : ti ∈ [1,n]. ∃ (x#j : tj) ∈ π => unify(ti, tj)
          (MAN) -------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ e with x1 : t1 .. xn : tn : π. t ~~> e'

* FIX: typing declarations now triggers automatic resolution whenever unification occurs. This makes generalization perform one last attempt in case let-bindings are explicitly typed.
* FIX: looking up overloaded symbol automatically refreshes type variables (which are not quantified, hence the need to refresh explicitly)
* FIX: instantiate function now applies the renaming substitution AFTER having created the new constraints (probably its the same as before, but it makes more sense)


7/10/2014:
* NEW: 'do' keyword must be prefixed in combine constructs
* UP: letrec bindings are now checked separately for simple pattern usage and for value restruction over arrow types
* FIX: some bugs of the solve constructrs
* TODO: manual resolution still does not work


6/10/2014:
* REFACT: desugaring has now been redesigned with a helper function for every case
* REFACT: monad does not support yield-and-translate anymore; translate must be called explicitly
* REFACT: M.search_by_name result is not a variant anymore, but there is a set of closed active patterns in place of it
* FIX: checks for unexpected empty declaration lists have been added
* TODO: manual resolution produces an empty declaration list


5/10/2014:
* FIX: solve construct has now become a de-sugar according to the following rule:
                Γ ⊢ let x1 : t1 = x1 and .. xn : tn = xn in e : π. t ~~> e'
          (MAN) -------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ e with x1 : t1 .. xn : tn : π. t ~~> e'


4/10/2014:
* NEW: hint system now implemented
* FIX: warning and hint system nw have set of disabled entries rather than enabled
* FIX: no way to enabled warnings or hints exists anymore via command line arguments
* UP: unsolvable_constraint used to be a warning, but it has become now a hint notifyng the need to use the with-construct
* FIX: resolution now performs unification with selected candidate, both in automatic and manual mode
* UP: wildcards and unit constats in lambda parameter do not de-sugar to a match..with anymore; this lead to simpler and shorter code
* TODO: manual resolution still does not work


3/4/2014:
* UP: forcing of flexible resolution of an identifier is now done by suffixing '!' rather that '#'
* UP: resolution algorithm now pick a custom predicate as argument for applying non-automatic policies
* NEW: solve construct lets user manually resolve constraints by specifying explicit types for ambiguous symbols
* FIX: a few minor fixes and improvements
* TODO: new manual resolution does not work as intended yet


2/10/2014:
* FIX: instance type distance should now be fixed
* NEW: support for infix operators in parser
* NEW: support for partial application of binary operators
* UP: freevars are not prefixed by '?' rather than by a tick
* NEW: constraints can now be strict (:) or flexible (:>) meaning their resolution either must be an instance with the exact type or and instance having a principal type
* NEW: variable identifiers support now a suffixed hash '#' meaning resolution can be flexible for that identifier
* REFACT: cid mode can now be FreeVar and Overload only 
* NEW: automatic resolution is now strict for both type of constraints; VAL construct enforces flexible resolution
* TODO: does cid mode make any sense? That's not used by the resolution algorithm at all. Only pretty printing uses it


1/10/2014:
* NEW: two kinds of resolution implemented: when strict-only flag is true then only matching instances are solved, else also distant instances are. Now automatic resolution is strict-only while VAL construct
       is not.
* NEW: constraints now track whether a symbol is in overload or was a freevar
* NEW: overloaded symbols can be ticked and the resulting constraint is treated as a freevar
* TODO: this new system is not clear: must be designed more carefully


29/9/2014:
* OPT: let-rec evaluation has been tested for performance among the following techniques: (1) using a reference to Δ; (2) using a lazy Δ; (3) defining Δ as a recursive value. Fastest was (3)
* FIX: type mismatch error Report.Error.ng has been reformulated as "expected a type T1 but got a type T2"; calls to unification algorithm have been fixed in order to output the correct expected and actual types
* FIX: main expression of a program is now forced to be a value, i.e. not having unresolved constraints
* FIX: indefinite recursion in constraint resolution now checks that a given solved constraint does not appear in the set of constraints inherited by the candidate (name and type are involved in the check)
* BUG: constraint resolution could happen only when something has changed on the context: a hash check has been implemented but it does not work -- disabled temporarely
* FIX: resolution now behaves as follows: try to solve each constraint, when one is solved simply inherit the candidate's constraints and keep going; when the whole iteration has finished, then check
       if the resulting constraint set is the same as the input one then stop, else resolve again.


26/9/2014:
* NEW: predicate ejection implemented:
                Γ ⊢ e : π. { r } -> t    r = x1 : t1 .. xn : tn    y fresh id
                Γ ⊢ let y = { x1 = x1 .. xn = xn } in e y : π'. t' ~~> e'
        (EJECT) --------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ (< e >) : π'. t' ~~> e'

* FIX: inject and open typing has been rewritten by calling pt_expr on the traslated code, rather than typing natively
* FIX: let-rec bindings produced an infinite recursion, now that's been fixed using some magic


25/9/2014:
* REFACT: typing modules have been gathered under the Typing namespace; source file names now reflect module name nesting 
* NEW: pattern matching evaluation implemented
* NEW: support for all expressions added to evaluator
* FIX: overloading resolution indefinite recursion issue resolved (was already solved before the resolution system introduced it again)


24/9/2014:
* REFACT: state_builder monad now handles translation via a yield overload as well as a specific translate method; also the class is now parametric on the type of AST node that method translate supports and
          needs an AST for being constructed
* REFACT: unify and check_kind_star are now a monad members, because the previous design based on contexts was making things harder
* REFACT: resolve_constraints cannot be a monad method (unfortunately) but is a function picking the monad
* FIX: typing of open was bugged: translation now works and evaluation too


23/9/2014:
* NEW: recursive lambda implemented: fun rec x p1 .. pn -> e desugars to let rec x = fun p1 .. pn -> e in x
* REFACT: Intrinsic module redesigned and basic environments Δ0 and Γ0 have been merged into triples (name, type, value)
* REFACT: evaluator now have generalized reducible values, which closures are just a special case of and by means of which primitive functions are expressible easily
* REFACT: main reflects the new intrisic design
* NEW: namespace of compilation unit is now optional
* NEW: interactive mode implemented


22/9/2014:
* NEW: evaluator draft implemented


21/9/2014:
* NEW: val is now a first-class citizen within the expression syntax, and it behaves like this:
                Γ ⊢ e : {}. t
          (VAL) -------------------------
                Γ ⊢ val e : {}. t ~~> e

* NEW: let val x = e1 in e2 is a sugar for let x = val e1 in e2
* NEW: predicate injection implemented:
                Γ ⊢ e : { r }. t    x fresh id
                Γ ⊢ fun (x : r) -> open x in e : π'. t' ~~> e''
       (INJECT) -----------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ (> e <) : π'. t' ~~> e'

* NEW: let fun f = e1 in e2 is a sugar for let f = (> e1 <) in e2
* REFACT: most Absyn.Aux parser commodities have now been lifted up to Absyn and are constructor-like functions
* UP: let-over instance names have now form "x$n" (was "x#n"): this makes debugging translated code a little easier as they look different than constraint names
* FIX: open declaration are now translated correctly
                Γ ⊢ e1 : π1. { x1 : t1 .. xn : tn }    y fresh id
                Γ ⊢ let y = e1 in let x1 = y.x1 and .. xn = y.xn in e2 : π'. t' ~~> e'
         (OPEN) ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ open e1 in e2 : π'. t' ~~> e'


20/9/2014:
* FIX: let-over bindings and inherited constraint renaming sub-system now working as intented
* BUG: printing of App puts brackets on right hand when identifier - that should not happen
* REFACT: decl type wrapped into located<udecl>
* FIX: decl translation now fixed: multiple and-bindings are supported and translated correctly


19/9/2014:
* NEW: compilation symbol DEBUG_VERBOSE_CONSTRAINTS and DEBUG_VERBOSE_TYVARS (in place of DEBUG_VERBOSE_TYVAR_NAMES)
* REFACT: resolution sub-system now brought outside of pt_expr as a this-contained function resolve
* FIX: resolution now occurs automatically at every inference step: resolution attempts occur in a greedy way
                Γ ⊢ e : π. t'
                ∃ (x#n : t) ∈ π. (x$k : σ) ∈ Γ
                ¬∃ (x'#m' : σ') ∈ Γ. mgu(inst(σ'), t) < mgu(inst(σ), t)
         (AUTO) ---------------------------------------------------------
                Γ ⊢ e : π - (x#n : t). t' ~~> let x#m = x$k in e

* NEW: warning numbers and filters implemented, including command line arguments enabling/disabling them
* NEW: translation sub-system implemented and partly tested


18/9/2014:
* NEW: performance measure tools implemented in Globals for measuring cpu time
* OPT: substitution composition is 
* OPT: custom state monad redesigned: now Bind is not overridden: no more overhead given by constantly composing substitutions and constant applying to Γ and π.
       Now composition of tθ and update of Γ and π is done specifically when unification occurs (x3 speed increase)
* FIX: named type variables led to bad substitutions: now the numeric unique identifier is computed as the hash code of the name and refresh is sound
* FIX: refreshing of ungeneralized schemes bound by overload-bindings
* NEW: ambiguous overloading resolution check implemented
* BUG: overloading resolution is bugged: type information at resolution point is not enough for resolving


17/9/2014:
* OPT: state-monad default For method (FSharpCommon) has been reimplemented without foldback on list: it now uses recursion over an enumerator of the sequence
* OPT: substitution, composition, environment and monadic optimizations (x2 speed increase)
* NEW: compilation symbol WAIT_FOR_KEY_AT_EXIT


16/9/2014
* REFACT: kind infererence algorithm is not monadic anymore
* REFACT: mgu rewritten again: now it is not monadic anymore; function unify still is, as it updates the substitution within the state of the monad
* REFACT: each relevant algorithm now has its own context: a record with information that is not kept into the monad
* REFACT: let-binding AST redesigned again: now rec, val and over are qualifiers showing up as bools in a record
* NEW: support for overload (principal type annotation) and let over (instance binding) declarations
* NEW: predicate resolution has been extended to support overloading; best instance match has been introduced
* NEW: check for resolution recurring indefinitely: predicate is suspended in that case (produces a warning)
* NEW: let-over instances are checked against their declared principal type
* NEW: various new error and warning messages
* FIX: state-monad For was evaluating sequence in wrong order, a foldBack was needed; conversion to list has been necessary though


15/9/2014:
* REFACT: unify monadic function has been split into mgu (monadic) and unify (still monadic): the former computers a substitution, the latter uses the former and lifts the state
* REFACT: mgu internal recursive function has become monadic; the ration behind this choice is that it uses KindInfer.pk_ty which is monadic
* NEW: parser and grammar has been redesigned to support VAL as a binding-qualifier forcing predicate resolution; let syntax has turned to be more ML-like now
* BUG: where-bindings have been disabled, as the new let grammar does not support them easily
* NEW: predicate resolution has been implemented in a simple form: no best match yet
* BUG: predicate resolution does not yet resolve inherited predicate when possibile


12/9/2014:
* NEW: added where-binding constructs as a sugar for let
* UP: Monad builder in FSharpCommon has been rewritten in such a way that all non-atomic constructs are expressed by means of atomic ones. Bind, Return and Zero and atomics
* FIX: substitution composition has been FIX; no more substitution normalization required
* REFACT: auxiliary functions in CustomStateMonad simplified: no more A (embeeded in Bind now)
* FIX: predicate scope is now working as intended


11/9/2014:
* NEW: freevars added to syntax and constraints added to type predicate
* TODO: error detection of row types must be redesigned: as of now, a technical error message is used for row rewriting failures
* FIX: free type variables are not subject to renaming when printing schemes
* FIX: let-and bindings are now typed and printed in the original order
* TODO: check val-bindings and type predicate handling


10/9/2014:
* FIX: normalization of type variables in printing of schemes is now working
* FIX: when missing a label in a row type, a special error is shown
* TEST: unification of record type have been tested quite widely: open records passed as arguments to functions with open records parameters, viceversa and other combinations


9/9/2014:
* BUG: pretty printing of schemes with normalized type variables is still troublesome
* NEW: variants are printed à la ML with the "of"


8/9/2014:
